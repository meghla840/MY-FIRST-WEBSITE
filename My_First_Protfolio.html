            Hello! I’m Megh  a student, a beginner coder, and a curious explorer of the vast world of technology. Welcome to my personal portfolio, a space that reflects not just the projects I build, but the passion, patience, and perseverance behind each line of code. My journey into programming began with a simple sense of wonder: How are websites created? How does the digital world come to life? That spark of curiosity soon turned into a meaningful pursuit. Though I’m still at the beginning of this path, I’ve learned that every expert once stood where I am today — full of questions, fueled by dreams, and driven by a desire to create. Each step I take, no matter how small, adds to my growth. I face errors, frustrations, and moments of doubt, but I welcome them as part of the learning process — as stepping stones toward becoming a better thinker, builder, and problem-solver. I try to code regularly, stay curious, and embrace every mistake as a lesson. Outside the world of programming, I find peace and inspiration in nature, in books, and in the quiet beauty of the sky — moments that refresh my mind and remind me why I create. This is more than just a portfolio; it’s the beginning of my story — a journey shaped by creativity, curiosity, and a deep commitment to keep learning, building, and evolving. Thank you for being here at the start of this adventure

        <h2>🛠️ My Projects</h2>
        <p>As I explore the world of web development, every project I build becomes a reflection of my curiosity, creativity, and determination to learn. While I’m currently focused on strengthening my foundation in HTML and CSS, I’ve already had the chance to experiment with deeper concepts using JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Each project has taught me something different — from layout and styling to logic and structure — and together, they’ve shaped my understanding of how websites come to life. Here are two projects that hold a special place in my journey:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
        <div id="booknest">
            <div > 
            <h3 id="book">📚 BookNest – A Simple eBook Web App</h3>
            <p id="booknestpara">BookNest was one of my first full-fledged web app ideas — a platform where users could explore digital books in an organized and user-friendly layout. In this project, I didn’t just use HTML and CSS, but also experimented with JavaScript, PHP, and SQL to make the site more functional. I tried implementing features like book listings, categories, and simple database handling. Although it was a learning experience with many challenges, it helped me understand the importance of logic, backend structure, and how different technologies connect to make a website dynamic. Now, as I revisit web development from the basics, I see even more clearly how much I still have to learn — and that excites me. BookNest remains a proud early step that motivates me to build even better things in the future.</p>

        <div id="greeting">
            <div><h3 id="greet">🌙 Eid Greeting Website</h3>
            <p id="greetingpara">This was a creative and heartwarming project where I designed a festive website to share Eid greetings in a visually appealing way. Built with just HTML and CSS, this project allowed me to focus fully on visual design, layout, and emotion through styling. I used soft colors, celebratory fonts, and thoughtful spacing to create a joyful, peaceful atmosphere. It reminded me how powerful simple web design can be when it’s made with care and intention. Even without complex logic, this project taught me how to bring a personal touch to web experiences.</p>

           <h2>🌎 From Where I Learn HTML & CSS</h2> 
                <p>I started learning HTML and CSS from Programming Hero, a platform created by Jhankar Mahbub. He explains everything in a very fun and beginner-friendly way. His teaching style makes complex topics feel simple and enjoyable.

                If you’re just getting started with web development, I highly recommend his videos. Here’s one of them that helped me a lot:
